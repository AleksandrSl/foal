# Authentication and Access Control

This section explains how authentication and authorization are handled in FoalTS.

*Authorization*, also known as *Access Control*, is mediating access to resources on the basis of identity. It answers the question *What the user is allowed to do?*. In this way it differs from *authentication* which, upstream, answers the question *Who is the user?*.

FoalTS offers several ways to manage authentication and authorization based on your needs and the complexity of your application.
