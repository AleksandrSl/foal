# Introduction

This section explains how authentication and authorization are handled in FoalTS.

_Authorization_, also known as _Access Control_, is mediating access to resources on the basis of identity. It answers the question _What the user is allowed to do?_. In this way it differs from _authentication_ which, upstream, answers the question _Who is the user?_.

FoalTS offers several ways to manage authentication and authorization based on your needs and the complexity of your application.
